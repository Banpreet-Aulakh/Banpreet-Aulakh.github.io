## Welcome to my github pages stand-in site!

I'll be working on a portfolio website to replace this, but feel free to visit my github and view my repositories in the meantime! I have lots of cool projects there!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
