## Welcome to my github pages stand-in site!

I'll be working on a portfolio website to replace this, but feel free to visit my github and view my repositories in the meantime! I'll also be adding personal projects I'm working on below.

## The Odin Project 

### Project 1: Odin-Recipes (June 2022)
I spent Summer 2022 learning the basics of web development on The Odin Project. The first project I did was called "Odin Recipes". It was simple to implement as it used basic HTML tags, but I was required to set up a Linux workspace beforehand. At the time I was doing this VirtualBox (The Odin Project Recommended VM software) was not supported on Windows 11, my current OS. Instead, I set up a full Linux environment on my PC using WSL Ubuntu as I was already using it with g++ compiler during my Data Structures course and any issues I ran into were luckily solved with a quick google search. To complete this project I also used git version control for the first time in a linux terminal exclusively. The commit messages are pretty messed up, but it really helped me get the hang of git. I've included a link below to the website itself, so feel free to check it out!

**CAUTION This site is quite unappealing to the eyes as it's just a blob of html**
