# Hi, I'm Banpreet. Welcome to my GitHub.io Standin Site!

I'm currently a 4th Year Computing Science student at SFU. I also have a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology specializing in Power Systems and Industrial Controls! As I continue my programming journey I hope I can update this domain to look better, but until then It's just a template. 

Anyways, I'm rambling.If you found this then you're either a potential employer or a someone who I sent this link to check out. Please feel free to look at my github repo for actual stuff I've done or am doing. I'll try my best to post some of the highlights from the repo here though! I plan to finish my degree by May 2024 if everything goes well. But, I'm open to postponing it for a co-op or internship! 

## Relevant Courses Taken 

CMPT 225 - Data Structures and Programming (Learned Basic Data Structures and Algorithms. Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees, Sorting, Traversal)

CMPT 276 - Intro to Software Engineering (Agile Android app development. Git Version Control, Scrum, JUnit testing, Requirements Engineering) 

CMPT 354 - Intro to Databases (SQL, Normalization, ER Model, Relational Model, MySQL/Microsoft SQL Server)

## Career Interests

I'm interested in embedded systems and working on small form factor devices or embedded subsystems within larger devices. With my Electrical background I hope my knowledge can help work on something amazing. This doesn't mean other fields in computing don't interest me though. The entire reason I switched my career path from Electrical Engineering to Computing Science is the ability to truly build anything I can imagine and I try to learn as much as possible to achieve that. 

# Hobbies & Personal Projects
This is the part where I tell you things I like and try to make it sound interesting! 

1. Running (When I can, hoping to get into a morning run routine soon)
2. Physics and Astronomy (Been an Astronomy / Astrophysics nerd since I was 10 Years old!)
3. Gaming (Mostly Single Player RPGs, but I have like 3000 hours in Dota 2. Cyberpunk 2077 is my current favourite RPG if you're wondering.)
4. Watching competive sports (UFC, Basketball, E-sports) 

## The Odin Project (Postponed for when I have more free time.) 
I spent Summer 2022 learning the basics of web development on The Odin Project. I was required to set up a Linux workspace beforehand. At that time VirtualBox, the Odin Project recommended VM software, was not supported on Windows 11, my current OS. Instead, I set up a full Linux environment on my PC using WSL Ubuntu as I was already using it with the g++ compiler during my Data Structures course and any issues I ran into were luckily solved with a quick google search. The projects I have completed (so far) are all listed neatly with their respective descriptions alongside what I learned from doing them.

### Project 1: Odin-Recipes (June 2022)
The first project I did was called "Odin Recipes" it was quite simple to implement as it used basic HTML tags but to complete this project I also used git version control for the first time in a Linux terminal. Due to this, The commit messages are pretty ugly, but it helped me get the hang of git and learn how to make clear and concise commits to a project. I've included a link below to the website itself, so feel free to check it out!

**CAUTION This site is quite unappealing to the eyes as it's just a blob of html**
